            The Sound Gap was founded to bridge the gap between musicians, creators, and listeners. We see a gap in people listening to music and wanting to know more about who made it, why, and what does it mean to them?
          </h2>
          <h2>
            We want to tell the stories, inspirations, and intentions behind artistsâ€™ sounds undistorted by the media and preconceptions, so that we feel more connected to to the music and the creators feel more heard.

                Hi! I'm Elie. Ayla and I are working on "The Sound Gap" together. I'm in charge of making the website, so any thing you like on here, feel free to let me know! I'm a working musician in Montreal by night and a web developer by day. To see more of my coding work check out <a href="https://www.hymowitz.org">my portfolio</a>, and you'll see some of the music I play too! Happy reading :)

                Hey! I'm Ayla, I am the founder and co-creator of "The Sound Gap". I wanted to create a platform/ collective where we get to know the people behind the music, beyond projections, and not-interesting questions, and to bridge the gap between what is heard and what is created. I am a musician and studied Music Technology at school. Currently singing/ songwriting. "The Sound Gap" for me is a way to share the stories and intentions behind music and musicians I love, to spark stimulating conversations about music, and to have an excuse to listen to more music :)
