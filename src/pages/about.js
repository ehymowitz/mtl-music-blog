        is a music collective. Created to bypass the noise and warped images of artists in media to dive deep into the artists behind the sounds: allowing the stories, the intentions, and the realities that create the music you hear.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe in being real.
      </p>
      <p>
        We want artists to be truly seen and heard.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you see it deeply, you hear it differently.
